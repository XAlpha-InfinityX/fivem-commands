## Databases

### MySQL/MariaDB

Our server uses a MySQL-forked database called MariaDB. 
- MySQL is a free relational database management system (RDBMS). As the name implies, it is a SQL-based database using tables to store relational and structured data.
- MariaDB is a fork of the MySQL database with the intention to remain open-sourced and free. It as developed after MySQL was acquired by Oracle Corp.

### SQLite

As mentioned above, our server also connects to a SQLite database separate from MariaDB in order to smoothly integrate the FivePD resource.
- SQLite is a small, fast, self-contained SQL database engine which requires zero-configuration and runs serverless. It's useful as an embedded database that may ship with a desktop application that only needs a simple abstraction around a file.
