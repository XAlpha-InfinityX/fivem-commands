### RageUI

[Link](https://forum.cfx.re/t/canceled-lua-rageui/931651)
[Github](https://github.com/ImBaphomettt/RageUI)

RageUI is a library giving developers the ability to create menus similar to the one of GTA Online. It is required for many other menu-based resources, such as vMenu.

### NativeUI (In Lua)

[Link](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-dev-nativeuilua/98318)
[Github](https://github.com/FrazzIe/NativeUILua)

This resource converts NativeUI to Lua. NativeUI itself is a ScriptHookDotNet based library that helps you quickly and easily build Rockstar-like menus. This is required for other menu-based resources, such as EUP.

### vMenu

[Link](https://docs.vespura.com/vmenu)
[Github](https://github.com/TomGrobbe/vMenu)

vMenu is a custom server-side trainer/menu. It gives server owners full permissions support.

Features include:
- Player options like god mode, heal, wanted level, etc.
- Advanced multiplayer character customization, saving, and spawning
- Vehicle options, including saving cars
- Miscellaneous features and settings including developer tools
- Full permissions and configuration support

### EUP

[Link](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-eup-for-fivem-server-sided/139848)

EUP is an all in one clothing stream pack that contains a lot of emergency uniforms. it also comes with a menu so you can choose out of the big variety of pre-made uniforms. In order to integrate EUP to our server, we use the following resources:

#### eup-stream

This converts the original EUP (emergency uniforms pack) that was popular in LSPDFR to a server-side one compatible with FiveM.

#### eup-ui

[Link](https://github.com/WirzRexTon/eup-ui)

This resource is a UI menu for EUP. It was based on the original eup-ui, which used NativeUI instead of RageUI. RageUI has performance increases over NativeUI, which is why this version was converted to RageUI.

### visualSettings

[Github](https://github.com/Jarrrk/FiveM-VisualSettings)

A server-side resource that allows the ability to stream customized visuals to clients using a `visualsettings.dat` file. This file is commonly downloaded client-side for better lighting, but this resource allows the server to send it to all clients.

Note: If lighting looks off in any area, it may be due to the `visualsettings.dat` settings and may need to be updated.

### mythic_notify

[Github](https://github.com/JayMontana36/mythic_notify)

A simple notification system inspired by NoPixel's allowing developers to create notifications that show inform, error, and success styles.

### playerblips

## Development

### oxmysql

oxmysql allows FiveM resource communication with a MySQL database using [node-mysql12](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2). It works with both Lua and JavaScript, and allows using SQL-like queries to store and retrieve data from a database.

# Default FiveM Resources

# Personal Resources

# Others

## Databases

### MySQL/MariaDB

Our server uses a MySQL-forked database called MariaDB. 
- MySQL is a free relational database management system (RDBMS). As the name implies, it is a SQL-based database using tables to store relational and structured data.
- MariaDB is a fork of the MySQL database with the intention to remain open-sourced and free. It as developed after MySQL was acquired by Oracle Corp.

### SQLite

As mentioned above, our server also connects to a SQLite database separate from MariaDB in order to smoothly integrate the FivePD resource.
- SQLite is a small, fast, self-contained SQL database engine which requires zero-configuration and runs serverless. It's useful as an embedded database that may ship with a desktop application that only needs a simple abstraction around a file.

### Scripting

Documentation for how to create scripts/resources can be found in the [FiveM docs](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/).
